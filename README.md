Repository containing code for solving
[gaal’s circuit riddle](http://gaal.livejournal.com/234795.html) :

<blockquote>
There’s a box with three input signals: A, B, C. It has three output signals:
~A, ~B, ~C (that is, the negation of each input).

Design a circuit satisfying the above description. You have two NOT gates, and
as many AND and OR gates as you like.

(If you solve this, don’t tell me the answer — I haven’t solved it yet; I just
want to share the misery.)
